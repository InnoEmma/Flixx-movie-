🚀 Features

* 🔥 **Popular Movies** – Browse the most trending films right now.
* 📺 **Popular TV Shows** – Explore top-rated shows that everyone’s watching.
* 🔍 **Search** – Instantly search for any movie or TV show by name.
* 🧾 **Details View** – Click on a movie or show to see its release date, poster, and description.
